Watching TV is frequently seen as a social activity. Groups of people gather around the television for entertainment or information. One important application for TV viewers is content personalization, which consists in generating personalized content based on viewer interactions. Since the TV set is shared by many people, it is difficult to accurately capture the individual interactions from every viewer using a traditional remote control. As a new trend, the proliferation of personal mobile devices has changed the habits on audiovisual content consumption in interactive TV environments. In many situations people use their personal devices as a secondary screen to perform activities related to television watching. In this paper, we present an architecture for secondary screen devices that facilitates the capture of individual viewer interactions to use in content recommendation. In addition, this architecture can enhance the viewer interaction without interrupting the collective experience while watching TV.

\section{Introduction}

Watching TV is essentially a social activity, where family, friends, or people with a common interest share the same space and TV set for entertainment or information~\cite{Masthoff2004}. After many advances in technologies for interactive and digital TV it is possible to develop high level applications to enrich the TV experience. One important application is content personalization, in which content providers deliver personalized content to viewers based on their preferences.

The viewer preferences can be obtained by observing the viewing habits as interactions between the viewers and the TV system. Such interactions can be classified as implicit and explicit. Implicit interactions are part of the natural actions of watching TV e.g., change channel and volume. In explicit interactions viewers contribute by evaluating, commenting or sharing their opinion about a given content. Considering the data of thousands of viewers, the data captured can provide valuable information for content personalization services~\cite{Teixeira2010}.

The traditional remote control as a mechanism of interaction between viewer and TV can present some problems. Since watching TV is a social and collective experience it is difficult to automatically identify the viewer in charge of the remote control. In addition, explicit interactions that require the use of the main screen of the TV set (e.g., evaluate the current content or read comments) ends up interfering in the collective experience. Some researchers tried to address this problem

provide services which deliver personalized content to both individual users and groups of users. Such services depend on user preferences, which can be obtained by observing past viewers interactions with the TV system.
